This site is intended for sharing knowledge and projects i'm working on.

Right now i run my setup on a couple of old scrappy laptops. Which as worse as it sounds, is still a great way to start getting in to homelab. And i have learned quite a lot about Proxmox just this way.
I hope to expand in the future, implementing more advanced tech gear to the lab, such rack servers.

My setup consist of 2 Proxmox servers, one as Hypervisor and another as backup. In my hypervisor i run services such as Wazuh, an NFS server, a few docker containers (Such as Jellyfin, Kanboard, Dashy, netbox, nginxproxymanager).
