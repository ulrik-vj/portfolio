This site features a collection of my work, focusing on virtualization, cybersecurity, scripting, and Linux technologies.

# My setup

I run a network built around Proxmox and PFsense, with the following components:

> PFsense Router: For network management and security.

> Proxmox Servers: One as the main hypervisor and the other as a backup.

> Managed switch: For network segmentation and Port mirroring

Services on Proxmox Hypervisor

> UniFi Controller: Network management.

> NFS Server: For network storage

> Docker Containers: Running services like Dashy for dashboard to reach internal services, such as Nginx Proxy Manager for a reverse proxy and Nextcloud for private "cloud" service.

Feel free to explore my projects.
