This site is intended for sharing knowledge and projects i'm working on.

Right now i run my servers on a couple of old scrappy laptops. Which as worse as it sounds, is still a great way to start getting into homelab and how i got started. And i have learned quite a lot about Proxmox just this way.
I hope to expand in the future, implementing more advanced tech gear to the lab, such as a rack server or UPS.

My setup consist of a PFsense homebuilt router, 2 Proxmox servers, one as Hypervisor and another as backup. In my hypervisor i run services such as Wazuh for monitoring my devices, an Openmediavault NAS server to manage storage, and with docker a few docker containers (Such as Jellyfin, Kanboard, Dashy, netbox, nginxproxymanager).
