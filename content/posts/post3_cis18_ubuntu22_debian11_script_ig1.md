In the last following months i have been developing this bash script to get a better understanding of debian and ubuntu CIS 18 requirements. 

I have made it so that it ensures, that the new debian/ubuntu system, is compliant with CIS 18 IG1 remidations.

It will also work on debian 12. But, CIS is yet to create a new requirement list for debian 12, so use at your own risk until they realease the updated requirements.

While it still lacks some features, it works as intended when run on a fresh VM. I hope to add the remaining features in the future.

Enough said. Check out my repo and try it yourself!
