Hi, I'm Ulrik, and welcome to my webpage!

I've been looking for a simple design where I can use Markdown and highlight code effectively, and here it isâ€”thanks to Hugo and the no-js-hugo theme, with a little personal touch from me ðŸ˜ƒ

On this site, you'll find my latest posts about things I work on to showcase my skills, like my homelab projects and scripting.

Thanks for stopping by!
