# Introduction
Hi, i'm Ulrik and this is my webpage. I have been looking for a bare minimum webpage design, where i can use markdown and highlight code. And here it is, thanks to Hugo and no-js-hugo-theme. No complexity or advanced looks, just simple static websites ðŸ˜ƒ

Here you can see my latest post about some of the things i do in my free time. Such as homelab, linux related work or school projects.

Thanks for stopping by.
